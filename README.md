# Loan Amortization Calculator

## Overview

This is a simple Loan Amortization Calculator with a focus on providing accurate calculations, including a moratorium period. The calculator allows users to input various parameters such as loan amount, annual interest rate, loan tenure, monthly payment, moratorium months, and moratorium payment. The tool generates an amortization schedule that breaks down each monthly payment into principal and interest components.

## Features

- **Accurate Amortization Schedule:** The calculator provides a detailed amortization schedule, showcasing monthly breakdowns of principal and interest payments.

- **Moratorium Period Support:** Users can specify a moratorium period, during which only interest or a fixed payment is required. The calculator adjusts the schedule accordingly.

- **Flexible Monthly Payment:** Users have the option to input a fixed monthly payment. If provided, the calculator uses this value as the monthly payment; otherwise, it calculates the standard EMI.

- **Early Loan Completion Information:** The tool informs users if the loan can be settled before the specified tenure.

- **Summary Section:** A summary section displays the total interest paid and the total loan amount.

## How to Use

1. **Loan Amount (INR):** Enter the total amount of the loan.

2. **Annual Interest Rate (%):** Specify the annual interest rate for the loan.

3. **Loan Tenure (years):** Set the duration of the loan in years.

4. **Moratorium Months (Optional):** If applicable, input the number of months with interest-only payments.

5. **Monthly Payment (INR) (Optional):** Enter a fixed monthly payment towards the loan. If left as 0, the standard EMI will be used.

6. **Moratorium Payment (INR) (Optional):** Specify a fixed initial payment during the moratorium period.

7. Click the **Calculate** button to generate the amortization schedule.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of using the calculator:

```plaintext
